# tensorflow_c
This is a wrapper of tensorflow_c_api for c++ programing.
tensorflow_c is based on [hello_tf_c_api](https://github.com/Neargye/hello_tf_c_api) 
and partially based on [cppflow](https://github.com/serizba/cppflow).
Thanks Neargye and serizba.

Basically the interface is similar to cppflow. But we make some improvement on it. 
The implementation is new and based on `tf_utils`, which is cloned from [hello_tf_c_api](https://github.com/Neargye/hello_tf_c_api).
